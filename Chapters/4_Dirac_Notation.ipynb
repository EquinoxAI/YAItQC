    "# 4 Dirac Notation\n",

    "This chapter uses the maths from section 3 to describe some basic quantum mechanics.\n",

    "## 4.1 Bra-Ket not bracket \n",
    "\n",
    " When giving a quantum mechanical description of a physical system it is more convenient to use a suitable shorthand. In 1939 Paul Dirac came up with a notation that can describe quantum systems in a neat and effective manner. Dirac notation is used across all areas of quantum physics including quantum information. \n",

    "### 4.1.1 Ket?\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce explain the fundamental basics of quantum mechanics, it is still possible to continue with the coins. If the coin is heads up, it can be described by the state $\\ket{H}$. If it's tails up it is $\\ket{T}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When the coin is spinning in the air, the superposition state, this state can be represented by the state $\\ket{\\psi}$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ket{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\ket{H} + \\ket{T}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the coin has a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of being in either heads or tails, one may have intuitively expected this state to have a $\\frac{1}{2}$ instead of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The reason for this is that in quantum mechanics, a state is described with an amplitude (the factor by which it is multiplied) proportional to the square root of the probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be convenient to define the heads state using a ket as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ket{H} = \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 \\\\ 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the tails side up can be represented by the ket:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ket{T} = \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0 \\\\ 1\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows $\\ket{\\psi} $ to be expanded as :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ket{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "0 \\\\ 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can then be written in a much more compact way as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, if there were a biased coin which had a probability of heads given by $P$, the probability of tails would then be $1-P$.  The state of the spinning coin could be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ket{\\psi} = \\sqrt{P}\\ket{H} + \\sqrt{1-P}\\ket{T}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\ket{\\psi} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.2 Bra?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the bra $\\bra{H}$ is the same as the ket $\\ket{H} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ but a row vector where the complex numbers are all multiplied by $-1$. Since there are no imaginary numbers in $\\ket{H}$, the bra $\\bra{H}$ is just the transpose of the column vector as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\bra{H} = [\\ket{H}^*]^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the state of a quantum system $\\ket{\\psi}$ is referred to as a *wavefunction*. The wavefunction describes all the information we have availible about a system. In quantum computing the state of the quantum computer is described by the wavefunction (in later chapters a more advanced formalism will be introduced based off the wavefunction).\n",
    "## 4.2 Inner product \n",
    "\n",
    "For the coins, one may wish to know the probability of flipping the coin and observing it to be heads or tails up. With Dirac notaion, the probability of an outcome (heads up) can be calculated using the Born Rule. Using the coin example, the Born rule states that the probability of the coin ending up in the heads state $\\ket{H}$ can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(H) = |\\braket{\\psi|H}|^2  $$\n",

    "Explicity computing this gives:\n",
