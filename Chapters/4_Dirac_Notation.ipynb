    "This chapter explains a bit of the framework for quantum computing using the maths from the last chapter. It's like learning the language of quantum computing, first the grammar was introduced in chapter 3, now we are defining the words.  \n",

    "## 4.1 Information inside a computer\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a computer every day, it's important to be able to extract useful information from the computer. For instance, reading emails requires being able to access the information in your inbox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike reading emails, quantum computing works at the lowest level of the system. It would be like directly accessing the bits in a classical computer. Instead of working with bits, quantum computing works with qubits. To do anything at all with qubits, it's important to describe what state they're in. The state of a qubit is described by something known as a ket. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1.1 How to describe qubits?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we describe the state of our qubits? It is easy to think this would require a very complicated mechanism. For us, it is as simple as a column vector! The state of our quantum computer can be described with a __column vector known as a ket__. Because it is a state represented by a vector, we call this the __state vector__. Usually, the state of our quantum computer is given by the ket $\\ket{\\psi}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coins still work as an example for the state vector. If the coin is heads up we can use the ket $\\ket{h}$, if it's tails up it is $\\ket{t}$. When the coin is spinning in the air, the superposition state (see section 1.3), this state can be represented by the state $\\ket{\\psi}$: \n",

    "\\ket{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{h} + \\ket{t})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the coin has a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of being in either heads or tails, you might have expected to see $\\frac{1}{2}$ instead of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The reason for this is that in quantum mechanics, a state is described with an amplitude (the number outside the ket) proportional to the square root of the probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can write out our kets as the simplest column vectors\n",

The probability of getting tails would be $ P(T) = 1 - P(H)$ which gives $P(T) = 1 -P$. So our probability amplitude for $T$ is $\\sqrt{1 - P}$. The state of our coin is then \n",

    "\n",
    "In general, our quantum computer can take a lot more than 2 possible outcomes. Thankfully we can just add a row to our column vector for every possible outcome. So we can describe our state in terms of each possible outcomes it can take. Our quantum computer can output any number up to some maximum.  We can write the state of any quantum computer in terms of all the possible states (numbers) we can get from it\n",

Adding 1 more qubit to get 21 qubits gives us more than 2 million complex amplitudes. \n",

    "In the same way, we can get the coin bras. The $\\bra{h}$ is the same as the ket $\\ket{h} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ but a row vector where the imaginary part of the complex numbers are all multiplied by $-1$.

    "## 4.2 Probability of measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important features of quantum computing is measurement. Whenever we do a quantum computation, we change the state of the qubits. The strange thing is that we never actually see the state itself! \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example with the coins, we never see two coins with opposite sides up. The superposition can't be observed directly. Instead, we perform a measurement on the qubits to get some information out of them. The measurement has outcomes with different probabilities, described by the state vector. It's like the lift analogy in Chapter 1, the lift is never observed between two floors, we only see it at the floors. We also don't observe part of the lift on one floor and part of the lift on another floor. Something has gone terribly wrong if the lift is split across multiple floors!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the coins, one may wish to know the probability of flipping the coin and getting heads or tails up. With Dirac notation, the probability of an outcome (heads up) can be calculated using the inner product (see section 3.2.4 for a refresher on the inner product).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.1 Probabilities come from the inner product\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the coin example, the probability of the coin ending up in the heads state $\\ket{h}$ can be calculated as\n",

    "\n",
    "Since all the probabilities of the coin landing on $\\ket{h}$ or $\\ket{t}$ must add to 1, for a biased or unbiased coin, it must be that $P(H) + P(T) = 1$. Let the probability of getting heads be $P$. This gives us a state of \n",

For example, if the coin were heads up, and nothing happened to the coin, the probability of measuring heads would be 1. The probability of getting a tails would be 0. This can be verified by working out the probability of measuring tails. The probability of measuring tails $P(T)$ is still given by the same equation \n",

For instance, a farmer would want to know how good their next harvest would be, or a stockbroker would want to know whether or not a stock is going to go up or down in price. In those cases, the farmer is not interested in the probability of getting an exact crop yeild, but wants to know what yeild they should expect.
