    "\n",
    "When doing a computation, we are really interested in how long it will take. How long it takes to solve a problem depends on the algorithm. If the algorithm has a lot of steps, it will take the computer longer to solve them problem. It also depends on how fast the computers is/ speed of the memory or ability to use hardware acceleration (GPUs) or parallelise the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the speed of the hardware varies for every computer, we prefer to consider how many steps the algorithm has. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, complexity theory is the study of how hard problems are to solve. The hardness is described by the number of steps an algorithm needs to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, adding two n-digit numbers will require on the order of n operations. Multiplication \n",

    "### 8.3.1 Grover's Search Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very common to encounter problems that revolve around being able to find an optimal solution from a large quantity of possible solutions. Usually there is some structure in the solutions, for example searching a an address book alphabetically, but in many cases the complexity of the problem can cause the set of solutions to become unstructured. In the worst case, if the best solution is to guess at random for the solution then the probability of getting the ideal solution becomes $1/N$ for $N$ possible solutions. On average, $N/2$ guesses would need to be made for the problem to be solved. Such problems, where finding a solution requires a number of steps proportional to $N$ can be described using complexity theory as being $O(N)$. If $N$ were to be very large, for example $10^{24}$, finding the correct answer would take an exceptionally long time and require the most powerful supercomputer to brute force solve to even be possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1996 Lov Grover proposed a quantum algorithm that can accomplish this same task in fewer steps. Grover's search algorithm is able to achieve a solution in $O(\\sqrt{N})$ steps. In turn this could reduce the number of steps from $\\sim 10^{24}$ to $\\sim 10^{12}$ - a speedup of a trillion *in theory*.\n",

    "### What is Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "In recent decades the rapid development of cheap and powerful classical processing units has transformed all aspects of society. Artificial intelligence has been pondered by humanity from as far back as the 1800's but has remained the realm of science fiction until numerous great advances in the capability of computers has facilitated many implementations of AI across various industries from medicine to the military. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these AI technologies are based on machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "### QC is a lot like machine learning \n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a few similarities between quantum computing & machine learning. They are both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built on linear algebra\n",
    "- Held back by expensive computational resource\n",
    "- Sometimes very difficult to explain outcomes \n",
    "- Likely to go through period of hype & stagnation as technological development pace changes\n",
    "- Often associated with optimisation problems \n",
    "- Using Python & jupyter notebooks \n",
    "\n",
    "It's an open question as to whether or not quantum computing can improve machine learning. There have been some early experiments showing quantum machine learning performing better, but there have equally been experiments showing classical machine learning outperforming quantum machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    " Given the very limited number (& quality) of qubits availible there haven't been any large-scale tests yet. This is likely to change in the near future...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why machine learning could benefit from a quantum advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons motivating the use of quantum computers for machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Better sampling from true randomness of quantum states\n",
    "- Higher dimensionality from $2^n$ dimension only requiring $n$ qubits\n",
    "- Entanglement could be better for modelling correlations in joint-probability distributions\n",
    "- For data generated by quantum systems can be used much [more effectively on a quantum model](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7293)\n",

    "\n",
    "There are quite a few things to consider with QML \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are no proven advantages to using QML over classical ML \n",
    "- Quantum computers struggle to load large classical datasets \n",
    "- Many proposed quantum algorithms depend on quantum ram, which has yet to be scaled and integrated into QPUs. \n",
    "- There is significant academic skepticsm, [even in commpanies that promote QML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UsJV2BNj2U&list=PLOFEBzvs-VvppIb0jg5_aDbmFs36DXD9w)\n",
    "- If a classical ML solution works perfectly well for a given problem, it is much better to use that than a quantum version. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some optimism: \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum machine learning is still a very new field. It may take quite some time to offer benefits, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventional ML doesn't have much theoretical guarantees, but we know it works really well in practice. Given there are so many diverse applications of ML, one of them is likely to be well-suited to a quantum model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if our current QML approaches don't offer any value at the moment, further research may uncover models better suited to the hardware we have now...\n",

    "## 8.5 How much do we need?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely important to keep track of the resource requirements for any quantum algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it turns out that an algorithm requires thousands of qubits with circuit depths in the thousands, or millions, this will not be feasable with a quantum computer in the next decade. \n",
    "\n",
    "Across many of the proposed quantum algorithms, significant work has been done in reducing the requirements. This can be done by making circuits more efficient- using fewer gates and fewer qubits.  It is hoped that continued progress in circuit optimisation and improved hardware specifications will allow for better quantum algorithms to be implemented in the near-term. \n",

    "## 8.6 Quantum Strategy: Practical considerations \n",
    "\n",
    "- Try a small-scale proof of concept project first \n",
    "    - Small scale QC can be simulated on a classical computer. This can be a lot cheaper than buying access to an expensive QPU\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the problem require QC?\n",
    "    - Quantum computing is a rather exotic solution proposed largerly for problems tackled by supercomputers. Consider more conventional solutions before trying quantum\n",
    "    - How strong is the evidence that QC has an advantage for this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hardware \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Number of qubits (is it enough to run our algorithm)\n",
    "    - Quality of qubits (are the outputs reliable or just noise)\n",
    "    - Pricing/ availibility (can you afford it)\n",
    "    - Software features/support (how user-friendly is it, is it compatible with qiksit/ML libraries, does it support optimisation of quantum circuits ect)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cost \n",
    "    - Currently, access to QPU time is dominated by fixed cloud overheads (i.e. the provider). This means the costs can come down very quickly as the hardware scales. \n",
    "    - Energy costs are a large part of the costs of running conventional HPC clusters. For QPUs almost all the energy requirements are in cooling (with very little in control electronics). How this scales in the future depends on the qubit type. Optimistically, energy requirements could remain fixed for the next few years as the cooling requirements are constant for a significant growth in qubit quantity & quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.7 Limitations of quantum computing \n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantum computers are very small scale. As of the time of writing, the gate-based quantum processing unit (QPU) with the most qubits has 127 qubits. However this machine from IBM (named eagle) is not currently availible for public use. At the time of writing the QPU with the most availible qubits has [INSERT REFERENCE TO QPU WITH MOST QUBITS]\n",
    "- Current QPU's have high error rates. [INSERT FIGURE]\n",
    "- Quantum computing is very expensive [Reference]\n",
    "\n",
    "- QC is not a solution to every problem. For the vast majority of computational tasks, there is no proposed quantum algorithm. Thus, the vast majority of consumers are unlikely to benefit from QC in the medium term."
