    "On the many articles and news reports on quantum computing, QC is explained using the idea of qubits. This chapter will use the mathematical concepts to describe how individual qubits work. \n",

    "Like the previous example of the coin, a qubit has 2 states we can observe it in $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$. \n",

    "Dirac notation is really useful for doing algebra with quantum states. It is easy to add, subtract and multpiply wavefunctions and calulate probabilities with the inner product. One limitation of Dirac notation is that it is difficult to visualise quantum states as it does not have a diagram to represent the wavefunction on. "
