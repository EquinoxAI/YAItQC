    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a triangle can be made to any size but for quantum information only triangles with the longest side (the hypotenuse) equal to 1 need to be considered. All the triangles that satisfy this requirement can be drawn within a circle of radius 1 as shown below: \n",

Using Pythagoras theorem, usually stated as $ a^2 +b^2 = c^2$ where $c$ is the hypotenuse and $a,b$ are the remaining sides, one may easily derive the important equation: \n",

    "## 3.4 Beyond real numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "So far everything in this textbook has been described using *real* numbers- that is the set numbers you can produce on most calculators. For quantum computing, we require going beyond to complex numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.1 The square root of -1 \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two square roots of $4$: $+2$ & $-2$. For numbers that aren't integers there are algorithms we can run on our calculators to work out the roots to arbitrary precision. In physics there are many situations in which the only valid solution to a particular equation calls for the square root of a negative number. To make this work, it is necessary to first define the square root of $-1$ as $i = \\sqrt{-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using some basic algebra we can factorise any surd (square root number) into a product of two surds $ \\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}$. This holds true for negative numbers allowing us to take the square root of any negative number by breaking it down into the square root of $-1$ and the positive magnitude of that number. This can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{-a} = \\sqrt{-1} \\times \\sqrt{a} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{-a} = \\pm i \\sqrt{a} $$\n",
    "For example the square root of $-4$ can be written as $+2i$, $-2i$.\n",
    "These numbers that can be written as $ai$ are known as imaginary numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.2 Complex numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "Imaginary numbers work similarly to the real numbers everyone uses on a  daily basis. One can divide, multiply, add & subtract them just as you can for real numbers. What this also means is that any of $ \\div ,\\times, +, - $ operations can be applied to a combination of both real and imaginary numbers. For instance, the positive root of $-4$, $2i$ can be added to $3$ as $3 + 2i $. Any such number that can be written as a sum of a real and imaginary number is called a *complex number*. More generally we can define this mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = a + ib $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $a$ and $b$ are purely real numbers. The real part of $z$ is known as $ Re(z) = a$ and similarly the imaginary component of is $ Im(z) = b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.3 The Argand Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers can be represented on a graph by splitting them into their real & imaginary parts. In the Argand diagram the x axis represents the real part and the y axis represents the imaginary part. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Argand_plane](Images\\A_plus_bi.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.4 Complex conjugate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every complex number has a real & imaginary part. By taking the imaginary part of the complex number and making it negative, we get the complex conjugate. For example if the complex number $z$ is \n",
    "\n",
    "$z = x + iy$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The complex conjugate would be $z^*$ written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$z^* = x - iy$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below the complex number $z$ is shown along with its complex conjugate. In this diagram $\\bar{z}$ is used rather than $z^*$ but it means the same thing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Complex_conjugate](Images\\Complex_conjugate_picture.svg.png)\n",
    " [3]\n",
    "\n",
    " Note how the real part is the same, but the imaginary part is on the negative axis. \n",
    "\n",
    " ### 3.4.5 Magnitude of complex numbers \n",
    "\n",
    " It can be very useful to describe how big a complex number is. Since it has a real component and an imaginary component, the magnitude of a complex number indicates how big it is across both these components. \n",
    "\n",
    " The magnitude of a complex number $z$ is denoted by two vertical bars as $|z|$. It is calulated the same was as the Euclidean distance as \n",
    "\n",
    " $$\n",
    " |z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n",
    " $$\n",
    "\n",
    " With $z = a + bi$. \n",
    "\n",
    " The magnitude of a complex number is important for figuring out the probability of getting a particular output from a quantum computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.5 Euler's formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going through all the steps of explaining where it came from, *Euler's formula* can be stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e^{i \\theta} = cos(\\theta) + i sin(\\theta) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of this is that one can represent any complex number in this fashion simply by multiplying the left-hand side by some magnitude. In the context of quantum information this object $ e^{i\\theta}$ is called a phase and is of exceptional importance. To explain why $\\theta$ is so significant would require its own chapter. Instead it shall be incorporated into later chapters as needed.\n"

    "Fortunately it is possible to make predictions about events which may happen in the future and thus to make plans accordingly. In some cases how likely an event is can be quantified by a probability. This can be given as a probability, for instance a 40% chance of rain, a fraction, for example a 1/2 chance of throwing a heads, or a decimal (less commonly used in conversation). In any case, when the probabilities for all possible outcomes are added up correctly they sum to 100% or 1. \n",
