    "\n",
    "If quantum computing was nothing more than a collection of qubits processed individually, there would be little point in building a quantum computer. Even classical computing requires more than operations on single bits to do even basic addition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having qubits interact with one another allows for more complex algorithms. Thanks to entanglement, one qubit can control what happens to another. This has some interesting implications for quantum algorithms. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before discussing the more exotic case of entanglement, it is worth generalising the case of single qubit gates to multiple qubits. "
