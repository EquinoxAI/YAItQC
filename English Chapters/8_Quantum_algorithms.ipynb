    "### 8.1 Complexity theory isn't that complicated\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing a computation, we are really interested in how long it will take. How long it takes to solve a problem depends on the algorithm. If the algorithm has a lot of steps, it will take the computer longer to solve them problem. It also depends on how fast the computers is/ speed of the memory or ability to use hardware acceleration (GPUs) or parallelise the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the speed of the hardware varies for every computer, we prefer to consider how many steps the algorithm has. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, complexity theory is the study of how hard problems are to solve. The hardness is described by the number of steps an algorithm needs to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, adding two n-digit numbers will require on the order of n operations. Multiplication \n",

    "### 8.4 How much do we need?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely important to keep track of the resource requirements for any quantum algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it turns out that an algorithm requires thousands of qubits with circuit depths in the thousands, or millions, this will not be feasable with a quantum computer in the next decade. \n",
    "\n",
    "Across many of the proposed quantum algorithms, significant work has been done in reducing the requirements. This can be done by making circuits more efficient- using fewer gates and fewer qubits.  It is hoped that continued progress in circuit optimisation and improved hardware specifications will allow for better quantum algorithms to be implemented in the near-term. \n",

    "### 8.5 Practical considerations \n",
    "\n",
    "- Try a small-scale proof of concept project first \n",
    "    - Small scale QC can be simulated on a classical computer. This can be a lot cheaper than buying access to an expensive QPU\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the problem require QC?\n",
    "    - Quantum computing is a rather exotic solution proposed largerly for problems tackled by supercomputers. Consider more conventional solutions before trying quantum\n",
    "    - How strong is the evidence that QC has an advantage for this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hardware \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Number of qubits (is it enough to run our algorithm)\n",
    "    - Quality of qubits (can you trust the answer)\n",
    "    - Pricing/ availibility (can you afford it)\n",
    "    - Software features/support (how easy is it to use, does it support optimisation of quantum circuits ect)\n",
    "        - As the technology develops, pricing will become more competitive\n",

    "### 8.4 Limitations of quantum computing \n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantum computers are very small scale. As of the time of writing, the gate-based quantum processing unit (QPU) with the most qubits has 127 qubits.\n",
    "- Current QPU's have high error rates. [INSERT FIGURE]\n",
    "- Quantum computing is very expensive [Reference]\n",
    "\n",
    "- QC is not a solution to every problem. For the vast majority of computational tasks, there is no proposed quantum algorithm. Thus, the vast majority of consumers are unlikely to benefit from QC in the medium term."
