    "# 3 Part 2 The mathematical minimum \n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of chapter 3 will cover linear algebra. Linear algebra is the framework for quantum computing, so it is very important to be familiar with. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Linear Algebra \n",
    "\n",
    "Like trigonometry, linear algebra underpins most of physics, engineering and computer science. Its importance is difficult to overstate. In 1939, Paul Dirac reformulated quantum mechanics using linear algebra [1]. His contributions to the development of quantum theory are significant and the notation used to describe quantum states with vectors is known as Dirac notation ( to be covered more in chapter 4). There are two key elements to linear algebra: vectors and matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.1 Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are objects that have both direction & magnitude. Velocity is a vector because it has a magnitude, the speed at which the object travels with, and a direction, where it's moving towards. In linear algebra, a vector can be denoted by putting an arrow over a letter as $ \\ket{v} $ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a car travelling diagonally across a road. At the same time, the car is travelling along the direction of the road as well as perpendicularly across the road. It can be said that the velocity of the car has a component pointing along the road and another component across the road. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes vectors useful to work with is the fact that a vector has components. These are the individual magnitudes of the vector in each direction. We can encode the speed of the car along the road ($v_{alon}$)and the speed of the car across the road ($v_{acro}$) in a vector with two components: \n",

    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "v_{alon} \\\\ v_{acro}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the vector $\\ket{v}$ has two components, $v_{alon}$ & $v_{acro}$ so the vector has a dimension of 2. In 3D space, any point can be described by 3 vectors. In general, a vector can be of any dimension, with any number of components. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can write any n-dimensional vector as\n",

    "Where the subscript $v_i$ indicates the i $^{th}$ component of $\\ket{v}$. Note the convention of starting from 0 and ending at $n-1$. This convention of counting from 0 is widely used in QC and conveniently is also used in python too. \n",

    "### 3.2.2 Adding vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be useful to add vectors. All this requires is adding the corresponding components of each vector. Adding two vectors, $\\ket{a}$ & $\\ket{b}$\n",

    "### 3.2.3 Multiplying a vector by a scalar \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors can be made smaller or bigger by enlarging them by some scale factor. To make a vector bigger by some scale factor, the vector is multiplied by a scalar. To scale the vector $\\ket{v}$ by some scalar quantity, $a$, this would be done by multiplying each component of the vector by the scalar factor. \n",

    "### 3.2.4 The inner product  \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be very useful to compare two vectors by measuring how aligned they are. Imagine two vectors pointing the same way. These two vectors would have a lot in common, and so would be perfectly aligned. The measure of how similar two vectors are is the inner product. The inner product can be calculated by multiplying each component of the vectors and adding them up. \n",

    "$$\n",

    "This gives a scalar quantity from two vectors and is used to indicate how alligned they are. The figure below shows this, where the length of $\\ket{a}$ shows the component of $\\ket{u}$ in the direction of $\\ket{v}$. This is then scaled by the length of $\\ket{v}$ to give the inner product . \n",

    "![Dot_product](Images\\Dot_product_visualisation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner product depends on the angle between the vectors. If the vectors are pointing the same way, it will be bigger, if the vectors are pointing in completely opposite directions, it will be smaller. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.5 Perpendicular vectors \n",
    "\n",
    "If two vectors have no components in common, their inner product will be zero. This can be shown by two vectors that have an angle of $90\\degree$ between them.  We call these vectors perpendicular. In quantum mechanics, the preferred term is *orthogonal* which means the same thing but applies to more than just vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example the vectors $\\ket{p} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ & $\\ket{q} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ have a inner product  of 0. \n",
    "\n",

Starting from the first row of $M$ we multiply out the elements of $M$ & $\\ket{a}$ starting from the left and add them up. Let's call the transformed vector $\\ket{a'}$.
