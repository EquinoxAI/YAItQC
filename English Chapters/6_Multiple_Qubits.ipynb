    "# 6 Multiple Qubits \n",

    "## 6.1 More than the Sum of it's Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "If quantum computing was nothing more than a collection of qubits processed individually, there would be little point in building a quantum computer. Even classical computing requires more than operations on single bits to do even basic addition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having qubits interact with one another allows for more complex algorithms. Thanks to entanglement, one qubit can control what happens to another. This has some interesting implications for quantum algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Back to Binary \n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone is familiar with the decimal system where counting goes as 0,1,2,...,8,9 and then we repeat from 10,11,12,... . Computers, classical or quantum $^*$ count in base 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Binary works the same way as the decimal system but instead the count repeats every 2. Numbers go as \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "0,1,10,11,100,101,110,111 \n",
    "\n",
    "Which in decimal would be \n",

    "### 6.2.1 Reading binary \n",
    "\n",
    "To read a binary number\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Count the number of digits in the number and take this number -1 as n\n",
    "2. Starting from the first digit on the left, if that digit is 1, caluclate $2^n$. \n",
    "3. Moving to the next digit on the right, if that digit has a 1, calculate $2^{n-1}$. \n",
    "4. Add the result of step 3 to step 2. \n",
    "5. Repeat this process for each digit decreasing the power by 1 each time until the last digit (which should have a $2^0 = 1$ calculation). \n",

    "An example of this is shown below\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Here there are 8 digits, so we take $n = 8 - 1 = 7 $. \n",
    "2. For the first digit there is a 0, so we do nothing. \n",
    "3. The second digit is 1 so we do $2^{7-1} = 2^6 = 64$. \n",
    "4. Adding $0 + 64 = 64$.\n",

    "Here we needed at least 6 digits in binary to represent a number with 2 digits in decimal. The decimal notation is much more efficient. \n",

    "## 6.3 Multiple qubits, multiple gates \n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing the more exotic case of entanglement, it is worth generalising the case of single qubit gates to multiple qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have multiple qubits, we can apply single qubit gates on all of them seperately. This follows the same rules as with single qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.4 Product States \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have acted on all our qubits seperately, what happens to one doesn't affect the others. If we were to measure one of the qubits, it wouldn't tell us anything about the other qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such states where we can seperate the qubits out are called product states. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general a product state can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{\\Psi} = \\ket{\\psi_0}\\ket{\\psi_1}...\\ket{\\psi_{n-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we measure the first qubit (qubit 0) and get a 0. The remaining qubits wouldn't be affected, so our new state would be \n",
