    "If quantum computing was nothing more than a collection of qubits processed individually, there would be little point in building a quantum computer. A single qubit can be modelled using 2x2 matrices - you can even work these out by hand! Even if we were to have a large number of these in parallel, it would still be very easy to simulate a large number of qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having qubits interact with one another allows for more complex algorithms. Thanks to entanglement, one qubit can control what happens to another. This has some interesting implications for quantum algorithms. \n",

    "Everyone is familiar with the decimal system where counting goes as 0,1,2,...,8,9 and then we repeat from 10,11,12,... . Computers, classical or quantum $^*$ count in base 2. \n",

    "1. Count the number of digits in the number and take this number -1 as n\n",
    "2. Starting from the first digit on the left, if that digit is 1, caluclate $2^n$. \n",
    "3. Moving to the next digit on the right, if that digit has a 1, calculate $2^{n-1}$. \n",
    "4. Add the result of step 3 to step 2. \n",
    "5. Repeat this process for each digit decreasing the power by 1 each time until the last digit (which should have a $2^0 = 1$ calculation). \n",

    "1. Here there are 8 digits, so we take $n = 8 - 1 = 7 $. \n",
    "2. For the first digit there is a 0, so we do nothing. \n",
    "3. The second digit is 1 so we do $2^{7-1} = 2^6 = 64$. \n",

    "We know $ 5 = 2^2 + 2^0$ so we can write 5 as 101 in binary. \n",

    "Before discussing the more exotic case of entanglement, it is worth generalising the case of single qubit gates to multiple qubits. \n",

    "If we have multiple qubits, we can apply single qubit gates on all of them seperately. This follows the same rules as with single qubits. \n",

    "So far we have acted on all our qubits seperately, what happens to one doesn't affect the others. If we were to measure one of the qubits, it wouldn't tell us anything about the other qubits. \n",

    "Such states where we can seperate the qubits out are called product states. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say we measure the first qubit (qubit 0) and get a 0. The remaining qubits wouldn't be affected, so our new state would be \n",
