    "If quantum computing was nothing more than a collection of qubits processed individually, there would be little point in building a quantum computer. A single qubit can be modelled using 2x2 matrices - you can even work these out by hand! Even if we were to have a large number of these in parallel, it would still be very easy to simulate a large number of qubits. \n",

    "If we have multiple qubits, we can apply single qubit gates on each of them at a time. This is the same as having a bunch of single qubits on their own, each having their state changed by the qubit gate. The simplest case is two qubits. Let's begin with our qubits in the normal starting state of $\\ket{q_1q_0} = \\ket{00}$. We can apply a Hadamard gate on the first qubit, $q_0$ to change it to the superposition state $\\ket{+}$\n",

    "So far we have acted on all our qubits seperately, what happens to one doesn't affect the others. If we were to measure one of the qubits, it wouldn't tell us anything about the other qubits. \n",
    "\n",

    "## 6.5 Entangled States \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that it's really easy to apply single qubit gates to a collection of qubits. In the last chapter, we saw that all single qubit gates can be represented by $ 2 \\times 2$ matrices. And each qubit can be represented by a column vector with 2 rows. So if we had a large number of qubits, we could still simulate a large number of $2 \\times 2$ matrices on a classical computer. If it is easy to simulate a collection of isolated qubits, why do we bother making quantum computers? \n",

    "\n",
    "In general programming, if statements allow you to include logic in a program. If a statement is true, the algorithm will do one thing, otherwise, if the statement is false, it will do something else. The computer first has to check the variables value before executing the next step of the algorithm. We can do this on a quantum computer by measuring our qubits, collapsing the superposition and then performing our next quantum gates accordingly. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- For example, in section 4.3.1 there was a game where if a coin landed up we got +1 dollar, otherwise (if it were tails up) we got -1 dollars. This works as a clasical if statement provided we add the value after the coin is landed and observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes quantum operators different is that we can apply them to the superposition. What this means is we can act on both the $\\ket{H}$ and $\\ket{T}$ amplitudes at once. \n",
