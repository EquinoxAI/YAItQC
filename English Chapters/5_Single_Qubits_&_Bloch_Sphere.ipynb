    "Having covered what quantum states are, this chapter will cover qubits and how we can control them. \n",

    "Having introduced some of the basic mathematics to describe quantum computing, let's get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all articles or news reports talking about quantum computing start off by explaining how qubits are different from classical bits. This chapter will use the maths from previous chapters to give a better description of these qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, the coin example was introduced with the heads & tails outcomes we can observe. A qubit also has 2 outcomes called $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$, we can just replace $\\ket{H}$ with $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{T}$ with $\\ket{1}$. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with the coins, our qubits can be in a superposition of $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$. We can have any probability of measuring $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$ (so long as all the probabilities are real positive numbers which add to 1). \n",

    "Dirac notation is really useful for doing algebra with quantum states. We can model how the qubits change using vectors and calulate probabilities with the inner product. One limitation of Dirac notation is that it is difficult to visualise quantum states as it does not have a diagram to represent the state vector on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Bloch sphere is a useful tool used to represent the state of a qubit. Below, the quantum state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is represented on the Bloch Sphere. \n",

    "At the top of the sphere  is the state $\\ket{0}$, at the botom is the state $\\ket{1}$. Our state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is somewhere in between so it is a superposition of $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$. The closer $\\ket{\\psi}$  is to the top, the greater the probability of measuring $\\ket{0}$, the same is true for the bottom with $\\ket{1}$. The angle $\\theta$ between the $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{\\psi}$ gives us these probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ are seperated by $180\\degree (\\pi)$ on the sphere, but they are perpendicular, so the angle between them is actually $90\\degree (\\pi/2)$. The angles on the Bloch sphere are twice as large as the angles for the qubits.\n",

    "We know the superposition state $\\ket{+}$ has equal probabilities of $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$. Where on the Bloch sphere would this state be represented? What is the angle $\\theta$ that would describe this state?\n",

    "To show probabilities, a single angle is enough. So why do we need a sphere? \n",
    "\n",
    "There is another important parameter that describes a qubit: the phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "At last, our coins will not work to describe phase, there is no analogue in classical computing, nor in probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two quantum states can have the same probabilities, but be completely different states.\n",

    "We call this state $\\ket{-}$ because of the minus sign between the $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of getting $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ is the same for both. If we were to measure either state, we would get 0 half the time and 1 the other half the time. Since the measurement gives the same outcome you might think they are the same state. \n",
    " \n",
    "They are different states, and suprisingly there is an easy way for us to tell which one we have. \n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if we apply $H$ on these states? \n",

    "$$ H\\ket{+} = H \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} ( \\ket{0} + \\ket{1})$$\n",

    "The $\\ket{1}$'s cancel each other out and the $\\ket{0}$ add together to give us\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\ket{0} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we apply $H$ once to $\\ket{0}$ we get $\\ket{+}$ and then applying it again goes back to $\\ket{0}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we ever have $\\ket{+}$ we apply $H$ and get $\\ket{0}$ 100% of the time. If we get $\\ket{1}$ we must have had another state to begin with. If we had $\\ket{-}$ would measure 1 100% of the time. \n",

    "### Exercise 5.3\n",
    "\n",
    " When we apply the Hadamard twice to a state, we get the same state back. Without doing any maths, consider flipping a coin. Why does flipping the coin twice not guarantee you get back the side you started with?\n",
