    "On the many articles and news reports on quantum computing, QC is explained using the idea of qubits. This chapter will use the mathematical concepts to describe how individual qubits work. \n",

    "Like the previous example of the coin, a qubit has 2 states we can observe it in $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with the coins, we can have any probability of measuring $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$ (so long as all the probabilities add to 1). \n",

    "Dirac notation is really useful for doing algebra with quantum states. It is easy to manipulate wavefunctions as vectors and calulate probabilities with the inner product. One limitation of Dirac notation is that it is difficult to visualise quantum states as it does not have a diagram to represent the wavefunction on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Bloch sphere is a useful tool used to represent the state of qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our qubit, we can represent the probability amplitudes on a circle of radius 1 (see 3.4 for the visualisation). The negtaive amplitudes get squared to give positive probabilities. However this is not enough to represent our qubits. \n",
