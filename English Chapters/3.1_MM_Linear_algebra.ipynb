    "# 3 The mathematical minium \n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst ths work is not intended to be a textbook on mathematics, it is worth outlining the core maths essential to understanding quantum information. Beyond the scope of this course, there are a great many applications of the mathematics covered in this textbook. A much richer understanding of the physical world can be understood by applying these topics to the nature of light, itself quantum fundamentally, as well as machine learning and many fields of engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Readers with a more rigorous mathematical background may find this material rather basic but may still appreciate the explanations and relationships between the topics. \n",

    "## 3.1 Linear Algebra \n",
    "\n",
    "Like trigonometry, linear algebra underpins most of physics, engineering and computer science. Its importance is difficult to overstate. In 1939, Paul Dirac reformulated quantum mechanics using linear algebra [1]. His contributions to the development of quantum theory are signifcant and the notation used to describe quantum states with vectors is known as Dirac notation (to be discussed in later chapters). There are two key elements to linear algebra: vectors and matrices. \n",

    "### 3.1.1 Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are objects that have both direction & magnitude. Velocity is a vector because it has a magnitude, the speed at which the object travels with, and a direction, where it's moving towards. In linear algebra, a vector can be denoted by putting an arrow over a letter as $ \\vec{v} $ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a car travelling diagonally across a road. At the same time, the car is travelling along the direction of the road as well as perpendicularly across the road. It can be said that the velocity of the car has a component pointing along the road and another component across the road. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes vectors useful to work with is the fact that a vector has components. These are the individual magnitudes of the vector in each direction. We can encode the speed of the car along the road ($v_{alon}$)and the speed of the car across the road ($v_{acro}$) in a vector with two components: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{v} = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "v_{alon} \\\\ v_{acro}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the vector $\\vec{v}$ has two components, $v_{alon}$ & $v_{acro}$ so the vector has a dimension of 2. In 3D space, any point can be described by 3 vectors. In general, a vector can be of any dimension, with any number of components. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can write any n-dimensional vector as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_0 \\\\ v_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n-1} \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the subscript $v_i$ indicates the i $^{th}$ component of $\\vec{v}$. Note the convention of starting from 0 and ending at $n-1$. This convention of counting from 0 is widely used in QC and conveniently is also used in python too. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.2 Adding vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be useful to add vectors. All this requires is adding the corresponding components of each vector. Adding two vectors, $\\vec{a}$ & $\\vec{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{a} + \\vec{b} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_0 \\\\ a_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_{n-1} \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} b_0 \\\\ b_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_{n-1} \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The same can be done in reverse, a vector can be split into different components. For example \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{a} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be useful for expressing a vector in terms of its components. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.3 Multiplying a vector by a scalar \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors can be made smaller or bigger by enlarging them by some scale factor. To make a vector bigger by some scale factor, the vector is multiplied by a scalar. To scale the vector $\\vec{v}$ by some scalar quantitity, $a$, this would be done by multiplying each componenent of the vector by the scalar factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a \\vec{v} = a\\begin{bmatrix} v_0 \\\\ v_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n-1} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\times v_0 \\\\ a \\times v_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a \\times v_{n-1} \\end{bmatrix} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.4 The dot product \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be very useful to compare two vectors by measuring how alligned they are. Imagine two vectors poiting the same way. These two vectors would have a lot in common, and so would be perfectly alligned. The measure of how similar two vectors are is the dot product (sometimes called inner product). The dot product can be calculated by multiplying each component of the vectors and adding them up. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example take the vectors $\\vec{u}$ & $\\vec{v}$ as \n",
    "\n",
    " $$\n",
    " \\vec{u} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} ;  \\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \n",
    " $$\n",
    "\n",
    " The dot product between them is \n",
    "\n",
    " $$\n",
    "\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    " $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "= 1 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 1 = 3 + 2 = 5 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is represented in the figure below where the length of $\\vec{a}$ shows the component of $\\vec{u}$ in the direction of $\\vec{v}$. This is then scaled by the length of $\\vec{v}$ to give the dot product. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Dot_product](Images\\Dot_product_visualisation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product depends on the angle between the vectors. If the vectors are pointing the same way, it will be bigger, if the vectors are pointing in completley opposite directions, it will be smaller. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.5 Perpendicular vectors \n",
    "\n",
    "If two vectors have no components in common, their dot product will be zero. This can be shown by two vectors that have an angle of $90\\degree$ between them.  We call these vectors perpendicular. In quantum mechanics, the preferred term is *orthogonal* which means the same thing, but applies to more than just vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.6 Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Another object, closely related to a vector, is a matrix. A matrix is just an array of numbers which you can perform a matrix product on. All the quantum gates will be represented as matrices, so understanding how they work will be essential for quantum computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.7 Matrix-vector product \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.8 Matrix-matrix product \n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix can also act on another matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.9 Unitary matrices \n",
    "\n",
    "For all quantum gates, an important property they have is that they are unitary. Unitary matrices "
