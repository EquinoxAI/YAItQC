    "Computing each probability for every amplitude is not too much work when there are only 6 possible outcomes. But imagine instead if there were a million possible outcomes. Then we would need to compute a million different probabilities. A million outcomes might sound like lot, nobody has a million sided dice lying around,  but that can be achieved with just 20 qubits. Rather than compute the expectation value by computing each probability one by one, we can use vectorisation to parallelise this computation using operators. "
