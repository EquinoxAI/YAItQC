    "A quantum ciruit is a diagram showing the operations that act on qubits to carry out a computation. All quantum circuits have 3 parts:\n",

    "1. Initialisaton: Start your qubits in an initial quantum state\n",
    "2. Computation: Perform a series of single and 2 qubit gates \n",
    "3. Measurement: Measure the qubits \n",

    "Many quantum algorithms will also interface with a classical computer. This is very application-spcific so it will be covered later. \n",
