# Yet Another Introduction to Quantum Computing

*I will simply express my strong belief, that that point of self-education which consists in teaching the mind to resist its desires and inclinations, until they are proved to be right, is the most important of all, not only in things of natural philosophy, but in every department of dally life.* Michael Faraday (1859) [1]


This jupyter book (to be compiled) is a collection of notebooks introducing the fundamentals of quantum computation, including a preliminary introduction to quantum mechanics. It is assumed that the reader has some high school level of mathematics. A basic understanding of trigonometry is important. To the extent that it is practical, the mathematics needed is covered in Chapter 3.

Rather than *standing on the shoulders of giants* this work sits on a pile of textbooks, YouTube channels and online resources. In particular, a reader may benefit from the following materials: 

Great introduction materials:


- [Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing, Thomas G Wong](http://www.thomaswong.net/introduction-to-classical-and-quantum-computing-1e2p.pdf)
- [Quantum Country, Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen](https://quantum.country/)
- Q is for Quantum, Terry Rudolph (Book, paid)

- [Quantum Computing UK](https://quantumcomputinguk.org/) (paid)


For those with more experience of physics and maths (undergraduate level)

- Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, Nielsen & Chuang 

Some chapters have exercise questions (with solutions being added) to help develop understanding.
